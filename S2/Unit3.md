# Intro to Debugging
* Programing languages have syntax rules
* Logic
     - Order in which various program parts run (execute)
* Bug
    - Any program error
        - Causes program to function incorrectly due to incorrect syntax or flaws in logic

* Debugging
    - Process of tracing and resolving errors in a program

# Understanding syntax errors
* Syntax errors
    - occur:
        - when interperter fails to recognize code
    - causes:
        - incorrect use of JavaScript
        - References to non-existent objects, methods, variables, etc...

* Runtime errors
    - Occur:
        - When interperter encounters a problem while program exdcuting
            - not nessessarly JS language errors
        - When interperter encounters code it cannot execute
        - Run-Time error can be caused by a syntax error
* Logic Errors
    - Flaws in a program's design
        - prevents program from running as anticipated
    - "Logic" reference
        - Excecution of program statements and procedures in the correct order to produce the desired results
    - EX: multiplying instead of dividing:
        + let ratio = 10 * 2; console.log("10 divided by 2 is " + ratio);
    - EX: infinite loop
        + for (var count = 0; count>= 0; count) {console.log("we have liftoff in " + count)};

# Interpreting Error Messages
* First line of defense in location bugs:
    - browser console dispalys
        - line number where error occured
        - error descripton
* Run-time errors
    - Erro messages generated by a web browser
        - can be caused by syntax errors but not by logic errors

* Example:
    + function missingCloseBracket() {
        var message = "this function is missing a closing brace.";
        window. alert(message);

* Error Message
    - Displays error's general location in a program
        - not an exact indicator
* Browsers do not strictly enforce JS syntax
* mitigating bugs in JS programs
     - Always good syntax
     - Throughly test with every browser type/version
        - Test browser if used by more than 1 percent of the market

# Using basic debugging dechniques
* Syntax errors can be difficult to pinpoint
* THere are a few common techniques that are helpful in tracking down bugs

# Tracing erros with the window.alert() method
* Tracing
    - examining statements in an executing program
* Window.alert() method
    - a useful way to trace JS code
    - Place at different points within program
    - used to dispaly variable or array contents or value returned from a function
* use multiple window.alert() methods
    - check values as code executes
* example: function not returning the correct result of 485
    - use the alert to check on the code during different parts of the code
    - the method "pauses' the program untill you dismiss the alert allowing you to check the program at different points
    + Ex:
        + function calculatePay() {
            var payRate = 15; numHours = 40;
            var grossPay = payRate * numHours;
                window.alert(grossPay);
        }
* Drawback
    - must close each box for code to cintinue executing
        - ca be slower than other methods
* use slectively at key points
* place debugging code at different indent level to distungusih from prrogram code


# tracing erros with the console.log() method
* trace a bug by alayzing a list of values
* logging
    - writing values directly to the console using the console.log() method
    - syntax: console.log(value);
    - can log a string literal, var, or combo
* drawbacks
    - can be clunky to retype
    - may help narrow down error but wont tell why it errors
    - cant help in large loops because it happens too often to disseminate (false)
* advantages:
    - can use strings to describe what the value should be or describe what it's ablout
    - can create list of things
    - use it please

# using comments to locate bugs
* Another method to locate bugs is to comment out problematic lines
* this helps isolate statements causing erros
* when erro message first recieved
    - start by commenting out the only statement specified by the line number in the error message
    - continue commenting lines untill error eliminated

* Drawbacks
    - commented code doesnt run so you cnt be sure code is doing what you want it to
* advantages
    - can allow youto test other parts of the code and come back later to fix

# combining debugging techniques
* combine to aid in serarch for errors
*Ex:
    - use comments combined with an elert box or log message to trace erros in the calculate() function

# Dependencies
* replationship in which one statement depends on another statement executing successfully
* Can make debugging more challenging 
* important to retest program after fixing a bug to ensure other parts aren't affected bt change

# Tracing erros with debug tools
* avaible in current versions of all modern browers
* accessible through the same panel that opens when opening the console

* examining code manually
    - usally first step taken with a logic error
    - works fine with smaller programs

* debugging tools
    - help trace each line of code
    - more efficient method of finding and resolving logic errors

# setting breakpoints
* break mode
    - temporally suspension of program execution
    - used to monitor values and trace program execution
* breakpoint
    - statement where execution enters break mode
* when program paused at a breapoint
    - use debug tools to trace program execution
