Introducing Resonsive Design:

    Page content
        Mobile - Content should be short and to the point
        Desktop - Content can be extensive giving readers the opportunity to explore all facets of the topic

    Page Layout
        Mobile - Content should be laid out within a single column, with no horizontal scrolling
        Desktop - With a wider screen size, content can be more easily laid out in multiple comumns

    Hypertext links
        Mobile - Links need to be easily accessed via a touch interfase
        Desktop - Links can be activated more precisely

    Network Bandwidth
        Mobile - Sites tend to take longer to load over cellular networks and thus overall file size should be kept small
        Desktop - Sites are quickly accesses over high-speed networks, which can mroe easily handle large file sizes

    Lighting
        Mobile - Pages need to be easily visable in outdoor lighting through the use of contrasting colors
        Desktop - Pages are typically viewed in an office setting, allowing a broader color palette

    Device Tools
        Mobile - Mobile sites often need to access devices such as phone dialing, messaging, mapping, and built in cameras
        Desktop - Sites rarly need to access device tools

    Three primary components of responsive design theory identified by Ethan Marcotte are:
        Flexibe layout so that the page layout automatically adjusts to screens of different widths
        Responsive images that resize based on the size of the viewing device
        Media queries that determine the properties of the device rendering the page so that appropriate designs can be delivered to speific devices

Introducing Media Queries

    Media Queries - Used to associate a style sheet or style rule with a specific device or list of device features
    
    To create a media query within an HTML file, add the following media attribute to either the link or style element in the document head
        media="devices"
            Where devices is a comma-separated list of supported media types associated with a specified style sheet
    
    Device types:
        All - All output devices (default)
        braille - Braille tactile feedbck devices
        Embossed - paged braille printers
        Handheld - Mobile devices with small screens and limited mandwidth
        Print - printers
        Projections - Projectors
        Screen - Computer screens
        Speech - Speech and sound synthesizers, and aural browsers
        tty - fixed width devices such as teletype machines and terminals
        tv - television type devices with low resolution, color, and limited scrollability

The @media Rule

    Media Queries can be used to assiciate speific style rules with specific devies using the following
        @media tty{
            body{font: 100;}
        }
    Where devices are supported by media types and style rules are the syle rules associated with those devices

Media Queries and Device features

    To target a device base d on its features, add the feaure and its value to the media attribute using the syntax in HTML:
        media="all/not and/or (feature:value);
            Where feature is the name of a media feature and value is the feature's value
            The and and or keywoard are used to create media queries that involve different devices or combinations of both

    Aspect-ratio - THe ratio of the width of the display area relative to its height
    Color - The number of bits per color component of the output device; if the device does not support color, the value is 0
    color-index - THe number of colors supported by the output device
    device-aspect-ratio - the ratio of the device-width relative to the device-height
    device-height - THe height of the rendering surface of the output device
    device-width - THe width of the renderingsurface of the output device
    Monochrome - the number of bits per pixel in the device's monochrome frame buffer
    Orientation - The general description of the aspect ratio: equal to portrait when the height of the display is greater than the width and equal to landscape otherwise
    Resolution - THe resolution of the output device is pixels, expressed in either dpi(dots per inch) or dpcm(centimeters)
    width - THe width of the display area of the output device

Applying Media Queries to a style sheet

    THe mobile first principle is one in which the overall page design starts with a base style rules specific to mobile devices
    Tablet styles are applied when the screen width is 481px or greater
    Desktop styles build upon the table styles when the screen exceeds 768px

Exploring Viewports and Device width

    Web pages are viewed within a window called the Viewport

    Mobile devices have two types of view ports:
        Visual viewport - displays the webpage content that fits within a mobile screen
        Layout viewport - Contains the entire content of the page, some of which may be hidden from the user

Creating a pulldown Menu with CSS

    The following selector can be used to select the submenu that is immediately preceded by a hovered submenu title:
        a.submenuTitle:hover+ul.submenu

    In order to always keep the submenu visible as the pointer moves away from the title and hovers over the now-visible submenu, use the following:
        a.submenuTitle:hover+ul.submenu, ul.submenu:hover
